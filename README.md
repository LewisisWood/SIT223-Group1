Purpose of Project:

The purpose of the website is to allow people to get feedback about the type of car they have or if they want to purchase one. The feedback can be any recalls that the car has had to ensure the customers are fully aware of the different faults the car previously has had. This can ensure the customers safety as they are aware of the possible dangers they could face when driving. The users can also create an account to get notifications about new recalls that happen. There is also useful information about the type of car as there is information about common faults that happen, and how to fix them and to see if you can do it yourself or if you need to go to a mechanic to fix them. You can also find how to prevent or maintain the car to prevent future accidents.

Target Audience:

People looking to buy a car either firsthand or second hand, as it can provide useful information about the faults it has and the robustness of the car.

People who already own a car as it can ensure they are safe on the road, and they prolong the life of the car and lower the risk of driving.
